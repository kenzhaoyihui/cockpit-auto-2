# cockpit-auto

This project usesÂ selenium and avocado to automate tests for:

    cockpit-ovirt-dashboard
    cockpit-machines
    cockpit-machines-ovirt

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Enter the project directory, install the dependency packages and enter to the virtualenv
```sh
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

3. Configure config.yml with correct parameters.
4. Run tests
```sh
$ python run.py $tags -g $grid -b $browser
```

**$tags** is the avocado tests filter, for example:

>`python run.py ovirt_dashboard|ovirt_hostedengine` is to run the tests tagged with ovirt_dashboard, and the tests tagged with ovirt_hostedengine.
>
>`python run.py ovirt_hostedengine,tier1` is to run the tests tagged with both ovirt_hostedengine and tier1.

**$grid** defines how to use selenium grid. It has three values, **none**, **auto** and **manual**. If this parameter is omitted, none is used.

**none** means not to use grid. The program will use local webdriver to run tests. Only chrome, firefox are supported in this case, you need to download chromedriver, geckodriver and put them under /usr/local/bin.
  
**auto** is to create grid automatically by docker-compose on the local machine. You have to install docker-compose beforehand. Only chrom, firefox are supported in this case.

**manual** is to use a grid created manually in advance. Here list the steps to configure a grid supporting Internet Explorer:
  
* Download Selenium Standalone Server and the Internet Explorer Driver Server [here](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).
* Configure Internet Explorer. For Internet Explorer tests you should make some additional configuration on the browser. See [IE Required Configuration](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver#required-configuration)
* Start selenium hub: 
```sh
java -jar path-to-selenium-standalone-server -role hub
```

* Start selenium node:
```sh
java -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=path-to-ie-driver -jar path-to-selenium-standalone-server -role webdriver -hub http://hubip:4444/grid/register
```

**$browser** defines browser type, includes chrome, firefox, explorer. If this option is omitted, chrome is used.
